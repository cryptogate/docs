# API

To use Cryptogate API you need to [create an account][1] and use API key. You can find it on your profile page. Then send it as `X-Api-Key` header with every request.

The base URL for all requests is `https://cryptogate.io/api/v1/`.

Cryptogate API will respond with JSON payload. It expects parameters to be passed in JSON with the correct Content-Type: `application/json` being set.

### Callback validation

A `validation_hash` parameter is added to all callback requests. Its purpose is to authenticate the call from Cryptogate to the callback URL. This signature must be properly checked by the receiving server in order to ensure that the request is legitimate and hasn't been tampered with.

The signature is computed by concatenating the API key with an invoice `hashed_id`, amount multiplyed by 10,000 and currency and applying a SHA1 hash function to it. You must use the following pattern: `"#{api_key}_#{hashed_id}_#{amount}_#{currency}"`

So if your API key is *supersecret*, hashed_id is *1q2w3e*, amount is *1.2345* and currency is *dash*, string before hashing should look like this:

```bash
supersecret_1q2w3e_12345_dash
```

Then hash it with SHA1 function and you will get validation hash.

```ruby
validation_hash = Digest::SHA1.hexdigest('supersecret_1q2w3e_12345_dash')
```

or

```php
$validationHash = sha1('supersecret_1q2w3e_12345_dash');
```
